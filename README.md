## :a: About 

At the start of 2021, I wanted to improve my data skills with Python. I've used it to build some fun projects, such as working out the [life expectancy of chess pieces](https://github.com/wjsutton/life_expectancy_in_chess) and finding the [resale value of Pokemon trading cards](https://github.com/wjsutton/pokemon_tcg_stockmarket).

Now I want to pass on that knowledge. Python Charmers is a project-based learning course, with daily tasks taking around 15 minutes, with Fridays being acting catch-up days or bonus project days for those with time. 

This course is designed to be beginner-friendly. The first week will be getting set up, in future weeks we'll dive into different areas showing you all the fun things possible with python. 

At times this course will require you to search around for an answer, I will always recommend Stack Overflow as the first place to look, other times a reading will be provided. 

Below are the current tasks for you to tackle. Good luck!
