Learning python through 15 minute daily projects.

### Day 01: Pip install...

The python community develop and maintain packages of code allowing you to perform several different tasks easily. Numpy and pandas are two incredibly helpful packages for data manipulation. Today we’ll install them and start using them.

- Open VS Code
- Top Menu  Bar > Select ‘Terminal’ > Select ‘New Terminal’
- In the terminal window type:

```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy 
```

“Pip” is python’s package installer. If you receive errors, it may be that pip isn’t installed, in which case try running: 

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip 
```

Importance of being able to pickup another script and use it.
