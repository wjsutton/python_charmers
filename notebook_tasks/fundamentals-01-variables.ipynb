    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable in Python is like a container or a label that you can use to store information. Think of it as a box where you can put something, like a number or a piece of text, and then use that box's label to refer to what's inside it later in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data analysts, variables are extremely useful for several reasons:\n",
    "- **Storing Data**: Variables can hold data that you need to analyze. This could be numbers, text, dates, or more complex data like lists and tables.\n",
    "- **Code Readability**: By giving meaningful names to variables (like sales_data or customer_age), your code becomes easier to read and understand. This is especially important when you're working on large projects or collaborating with others.\n",
    "- **Manipulating Data**: Variables allow you to easily manipulate data. For example, you can perform calculations on numerical data, combine text data, or reorganize lists.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Once you store data in a variable, you can use it multiple times throughout your program without having to retype it or retrieve it again from its original source.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Analysis**: Variables make your analysis dynamic. Instead of having hard-coded values, you can change the values of variables to see how different inputs affect your analysis results.\n",
